# WpfChatApplication
WPF Chat Application from AngelSix YouTube chanel

All code is taken from tutorial on YouTube channel [AngelSix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3AxeCHGPZkMi3kRfCuiHw)

For the target framework I used .NET 5.0

## Tips

If you want to use Icon, like it is in this application, use for images options (properties):
* "Build Action" -> Content
* "Copy to OutputDirectory" -> Copy always
